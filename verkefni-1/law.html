<h1>House Targaryen</h1>
<p><strong>House Targaryen of Dragonstone </strong><em>is a noble family of Valyrian descent who once ruled the Seven Kingdoms of Westeros.<br>
The Targaryen sigil is a three-headed dragon breathing flames, red on black The house words are "Fire and Blood".<br>
It eventually became the first royal house of the Seven Kingdoms, as </em><strong> Targaryen of King's Landing.</strong><em><br>
The only family of dragonlords who survived the Doom of Valyria,<br>
the Targaryens left the Valyrian Freehold twelve years before the Doom.<br>
They resided for more than a century at Dragonstone on the island of the same name, <br>
until Aegon the Conqueror and his sister-wives, Visenya and Rhaenys, began the first of the Wars of Conquest in 2 BC.<br>
<br>
Following the conclusion of Aegon's Conquest in 1 AC,<br>
they built the Aegonfort in the new capital city of King's Landing.<br>
The Aegonfort was later torn down and replaced by the Red Keep,<br>
which remained their main seat for the duration of their dynasty, and which housed the Iron Throne. <br>
Their original castle was almost always given to the heir to the throne, the Prince of Dragonstone. <br>
The Targaryens eventually built the summer residence Summerhall, <br>
which has been given to several younger sons of the family over time.<br>
<br>
House Targaryen ruled as the Kings of the Andals, the Rhoynar, and the First Men, the Lords of the Seven Kingdoms,<br>
and the Great House of the crownlands for nearly three hundred years. Seventeen male Targaryens ruled from the Iron Throne.<br>
The dynasty ended with the death of Aerys the Mad King during Robert's Rebellion, <br>
in which the Targaryens were overthrown and replaced by House Baratheon. The two surviving children of Aerys II, <br>
Viserys and Daenerys Targaryen, fled into exile,<br>
and have resided in the Free Cities of Essos ever since.<br></p></body>
